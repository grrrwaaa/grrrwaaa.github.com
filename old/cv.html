<li><strong>In press:</strong> Graham Wakefield. "Open Worlds: Bergson And Computational Ontology." In <em>Worldmaking as Techn&eacute;: Exploring Worlds of Participatory Art, Architecture, and Music</em>, edited by Alberto de Campo, Mark-David Hosale, Sana Murrani. Riverside Architectural Press, 2018. <div id="wakefield2016open" class="bibabstract"> These are exciting times for world-makers. Widely-available virtual worlds, whether fully immersive virtual realities, or mixed realities that blend with or augment the real, at last appear to be imminent. This path of worldmaking is suddenly widely-backed, affordable, and accessible, with eager anticipation far beyond the catalytic space of videogames including art, design, film, architecture, information visualization, and more. It bears all the hallmarks of the birth of a new medium. The conventions have yet to be frozen, the genres crystallized, the messages of the medium deciphered. And inevitably it is being understood through a McLuhanian rear-view mirror: projecting old game tropes awkwardly into new spaces, and struggling with the loss of the frame, the cut, and the directed view of cinema. Rather than extrapolating forward from the familiar in this way, as world-makers we would rather find a path to a reach speculative goal: a creative ontology that opens upon the vast creative poiesis that the generative grains of computation make possible, making worlds that approach the open-endedness of the natural reality we inhabit, including its endless capacity to change and reveal surprisingly new and fascinating phenomena. To this end we revive the nature-inspired creative philosophy of Henri Bergson, and address the challenges and potentials of re-projecting it into interactive computational media, to illuminate a way forward. </div> </li>

Riverside Architectural Press, 2016. <div id="ji2016recent" class="bibabstract"> Since 2007 the authors have been pursuing a line of research-creation that utilizes installations of highly-immersive mixed reality and interactive generative art to investigate new relationships with a future that is increasingly immersed in computation, but which draws more inspiration from the complex sense of open-ended continuation found in nature than any closed character of utilitarian closure. This project has produced in a series of 'artificial natures', whose installations account for over thirty-five exhibits across nine countries. These are proposed as viscerally-experienced explorations of the physical and cultural future of near-living interconnected architectural environments saturated in computational media. In this white paper the central concerns of the artificial nature project are illustrated with three examples, including ancillary contributions and key questions for the future. </div> </li>

In <em>The Oxford Handbook of Algorithmic Music</em>, edited by Roger Dean, Alex McLean, 293-317. Oxford University Press, 2016. <div id="roberts2016tensions" class="bibabstract"> In live coding performance, performers create time-based works by programming them while these same works are being executed. The high cognitive load of this practice, along with differing ideas about how it should be addressed, results in a plurality of practices and a number of tensions at play. In this chapter we use a lens of five recurrent tensions to explore these practices, including the balance of stability and risk in performance; the legibility and immediacy of code for audience and performer; the benefits and limits of musical and computational abstractions; the maintenance of flow and pace during performance; and the diversity of conceptions of time, determinacy, and duration that pervade live coding. Addressing these tensions contributes to the unique appeal, challenge, and power of live coding, and provides spaces to develop highly individual and expressive practices. </div> </li>

Users control the system by selecting and changing feature objectives in real-time. The system has a second-order structure in which the internal signal processing algorithms are developed according to an evolutionary process. Genotypes develop into signal-processing algorithms, and fitness is measured by analysis of the incoming audio feedback. A prototype is evaluated experimentally to measure changes of audio feedback depending on the chosen target conditions. By enhancing interactivity of an audio feedback through the intentional control, we expect that feedback systems could be utilized more effectively in the fields of musical interaction, finding balance between nonlinearity and interactivity. </div> </li>

A binding theme is the importance of endogenous accounts: that all perceivable forms have dynamic ontological capacities within the world; that the simulated world is able to autonomously originate; that as a result interaction can lead to exploratory discovery; and that visitors become part of the ecosystem, both through immersive display and through interactions that induce presence. Details of how each of these components have been applied in the visualization, sonification, and interaction design are given with specific examples of prototypes and exhibited installations. </div> </li>

In <em>Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference</em> (Denton, USA). University of North Texas, September, 2015. <div id="kim2015augmenting" class="bibabstract"> This paper presents the interactive enhancement of audio feedback through context-based control, leading to the generation of desired sonic behaviors by augmenting the effects of physical space in the feedback sound. Our prototype maps approximations of room reverberation to tempo-scale characteristics of the audio feedback. These characteristics are generated by a combination of adaptive amplification control and a digital variable delay line in the feedback loop. Room reverberation is inferred from the feedback sound by real-time cross-correlation of input with output signals, which is used to guide the variable delay line. This variation, coupled with an adaptive gain control, determines room-dependent tempo effects. </div> </li>

MIT Press. <div id="roberts2015designing" class="bibabstract"> Native Web technologies provide great potential for musical expression. We introduce two JavaScript libraries towards this end: Gibberish.js, providing heavily optimized audio DSP, and Interface.js, a GUI toolkit that works with mouse, touch, and motion events. Together they provide a complete system for defining musical instruments that can be used in both desktop and mobile Web browsers. Interface.js also enables control of remote synthesis applications via a server application that translates the socket protocol used by Web interfaces into both MIDI and OSC messages. We have incorporated these libraries into the creative coding environment Gibber, where we provide mapping abstractions that enable users to create digital musical instruments in as little as a single line of code. They can then be published to a central database, enabling new instruments to be created, distributed, and run entirely in the browser. </div> </li>

In <em>Proceedings of the International Symposium on Electronic Arts</em> (Dubai). The Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts, October, 2014. <div id="bang2014lost" class="bibabstract"> `Lost Fragments of Night' is a poetic documentary film that utilizes an algorithmic generative editing system to preselect shots to be rendered over four screens arranged in layers. The artwork's subject is the chaotic and contradictory sensations found by night in the city of Seoul. In this work, the themes of disconnected and paradoxical images in urban public spaces resonate with the concepts of the multi-layered screens and generative editing system. The fragmented images are distributed over layers of screens to emphasize a chaotic and simultaneous sense of fragility that nevertheless together forms a whole. Designed for large-scale installation in urban public spaces, our artwork has been prototyped via a physical miniature, projecting by rear diffusion onto four layered screens constructed of grey sheer fabric. The audience can appreciate the montage from different angles and positions to produce different layering effects not possible in traditional 2D cinema. The generative editing system uses a dynamic Bayesian network constructed according to clips and timeline tagging. Audience members can actively contribute to the direction of the montage through a web interface, so the artwork creates different experiences by embracing the role of the audience in every screening. </div> </li>

In AiRSculpt, as opposed to VR-based systems, users could quickly create and manipulate 3D virtual content directly with their bare hands in a real-world setting, and use both hands simultaneously in tandem or as separate tools to sculpt and manipulate their virtual creations. Our system uses a head-mounted display and a RGB-D head-mounted camera to detect the 3D location of hands and fingertips then render virtual content in calibration with real-world coordinates. </div> </li>

In <em>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</em> 8512 <em>Human-Computer Interaction. Applications and Services</em> <em>(HCI International, Heraklion, Crete, Greece)</em>, 103-113. Springer International Publishing, June, 2014. <div id="bahng2014digital" class="bibabstract"> The instant messenger has developed as an important communication media platform. However, because of the nature of instant communication, instant messenger services place many limitations on communicating with nuance. We believe that the easy nature of digital communications tends to weaken serious aspects of personal communication such as patience and commitment. On the basis of critical perspectives, we designed the digital messenger `Digital Love Letter' (DLL)': a mobile messenger in which the expressive process of interaction is more important than the final output. The main concept of DLL is to share the process of communication using a non-instantaneous and non-multitasking interface, so that users can share their time with some similar nuances to face-to-face communication. Both writing and reading messages require concentrated attention. Thus, this paper suggests a new system of digital messenger, that is also a new method of computer-mediated communication (CMC). </div> </li>

The three-story instrument, designed for large-scale, multimodal representation of complex and potentially high-dimensional information, specifically focuses on multi-user participation by facilitating interdisciplinary teams of co-located researchers in exploring complex information through interactive visual and aural displays in a full-surround, immersive environment. We recently achieved several milestones in the instrument's design that improves multi-user participation when exploring complex data representations and scientific simulations. These milestones include affordances for 'ensemble-style' interaction allowing groups of participants to see, hear, and explore data as a team using our multi-user tracking and interaction systems; separate visual display modes for rectangular legacy content and for seamless surround-view stereoscopic projection using 4 high-resolution, high-lumen projectors with hardware warping and blending integrated with 22 small-footprint projectors placed above and below the instrument's walkway; and a 3D spatial audio system enabling a variety of sound spatialization techniques. These facilities can be accessed and controlled by a multimodal framework for authoring applications integrating visual, audio, and interactive elements. We report on the achieved instrument design. </div> </li>

Springer International Publishing, May, 2014. <div id="bahng2014poetry" class="bibabstract"> <code>Poetry of Separation' is a media artwork that utilizes an algorithmic generative editing system, selecting shots in real-time to be rendered over four screens arranged in layers. Editing in cinema reconstructs images by montage, deriving meaning from the juxtaposition of multiple shots. Although multi-screen projections have been used to present sectional montages that stress the simultaneity of events, spatially separated screens can disrupt attentiveness and affective involvement; the layered architecture avoids disruptive fragmentation. The generative editing system selects shots for the layered screens stochastically, with authorial constraints and probabilities using pre-determined shot criteria. Narrative flow and authorial intents are not damaged due to these criteria, but nevertheless unexpected effects arose from the stochastic system. The authorial intentions of improvisation and separation in the film content of</code>Poetry of Separations' find resonance with the automatism of the generative editing system and multi-dimensionality of the screens. </div> </li>

Science eBook, Paris, November, 2012. <strong>Representative chapter.</strong> <div id="wakefield2012virtual" class="bibabstract"> Time of Doubles is an immersive, interactive art installation, and an instantiation of contemporary art research on the creation of possible worlds. It invites visitors to experience mirror existences of themselves taking upon new roles as sources of energy and kinetic disturbance within a perpetually changing virtual ecosystem. This world displays some characteristics familiar from our own, but is populated by unfamiliar life forms singing, swimming, and breeding through sensitive motions of dark fluids. The visitors' doubles are energy fields, which emanate myriad bright fluid particles, food sources to be eaten by the virtual organisms. Visitors see, hear, and feel how they are fed to unknown species in this virtual ecosystem. The immersive multimodal environment and volumetric sensors take the visitors beyond avatar-based interaction to become embodied within a world of physical and biological activity. The installation has been presented in gallery settings and CAVE-like environments utilizing 3D depth cameras, stereographic display and surround audio. As an immersive audio-visual installation, it brings forth a world of aesthetic play through the embodiment of complex multi-layered and inter-modulating systems. In this paper, the artists describe Time of Doubles from its conceptual foundations, developmental process and installation construction. </div> </li>

<li>Graham Wakefield. "Real-Time Meta-Programming for Interactive Computational Arts." PhD dissertation, University of California Santa Barbara, September, 2012. <div id="wakefield2012phdthesis" class="bibabstract"> In the interactive computer arts, any advance that significantly amplifies or extends the limits and capacities of software can enable genuinely novel aesthetic experiences. Within compute-intensive media arts, flexibility is often sacrificed for needs of efficiency, through the total separation of machine code optimization and run-time execution. Compromises based on modular run-time combinations of prior-optimized `black box' components confine results to a pre-defined palette with less computational efficiency overall: limiting the open-endedness of development environments and the generative scope of artworks. This dissertation demonstrates how the trade-off between flexibility and efficiency can be relaxed using reflective meta-programming and dynamic compilation: extending a pro- gram with new efficient routines while it runs. It promises benefits of more open- ended real-time systems, more complex algorithms, richer media, and ultimately unprecedented aesthetic experiences. The dissertation charts the significant differences that this approach implies for interactive computational arts, builds a conceptual framework of techniques and requirements to respond to its challenges, and documents supporting implementations in two specific scenarios. The first concentrates on open-ended creativity support within always-on authoring environments for studio work and live cod- ing performance, while the second concerns the open-endedness of generative art through interactive, immersive artificial-life worlds. </div> </li>

University of Michigan, 2012. <div id="roberts2012mobile" class="bibabstract"> Designing mobile interfaces for computer-based musical performance is generally a time-consuming task that can be exasperating for performers. Instead of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces' affordances, performers must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration, development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces, and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce sound. Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice. </div> </li>

ACM, December, 2011. <div id="ji2011time" class="bibabstract"> 'Time of Doubles' is an immersive interactive art installation. It invites visitors to experience mirror existences of themselves taking upon new roles as sources of energy and kinetic disturbance within a virtual ecosystem, a uniquely created computational world. Visitors encounter their doubles in a deep hyper space with 3D stereoscopic projection and 3D depth cameras. The immersive projection dissolves the illusion of a window to form an entryway into a shared, co-present world, and the volumetric sensors take the visitors beyond avatar-based representation to become embodied within a world of physical simulation. This world displays some familiar characteristics as our own, but is populated by unfamiliar life-forms swimming through the sensitive motions of dark fluids and singing continuously. The visitor doubles are energy fields which emanate myriad bright fluid particles, food sources which are eaten by the virtual organisms. Visitors hear, see and feel how they are fed to unknown species in the virtual ecosystem aesthetically.

Larger organisms leave physical residues and films behind as they pass, which constrain the fluid flows and which can be sculpted by visitor doubles. </div> </li>

June, 2010. <div id="roberts2010dynamic" class="bibabstract"> We present the Device Server, a framework and application driving interaction in the AlloSphere virtual reality environment. The motivation and development of the Device Server stems from the practical concerns of managing multi-user interactivity with a variety of physical devices for disparate performance and virtual reality environments housed in the same physical location. The interface of the Device Server allows users to see how devices are assigned to application functionalities, alter these assignments and save them into configuration files for later use. Configurations defining how applications use devices can be changed on the fly without recompiling or relaunching applications. Multiple applications can be connected to the Device Server concurrently. The Device Server provides several conveniences for performance environments. It can process control data efficiently using Just-In-Time compiled Lua expressions; in doing so it frees processing cycles on audio and video rendering computers. All control signals entering the Device Server can be recorded, saved, and played back allowing performances based on control data to be recreated in their entirety. The Device Server attempts to homogenize the ap- pearance of different control signals to applications so that users can assign any interface element they choose to application functionalities and easily experiment with different control configurations. </div> </li>

The Allosphere is at the same time multimodal, multimedia, multi-user, immersive, and interactive. This novel and unique instrument will be used for research into scientific visualization/auralization and data exploration, and as a research environment for behavioral and cognitive scientists. It will also serve as a research and performance space for artists exploring new forms of art. In particular, the Allosphere has been carefully designed to allow for immersive music and aural applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the instrument, focusing on the audio subsystem. We give the rationale behind some of the design decisions and explain the different techniques employed in making the Allosphere a truly general-purpose immersive audiovisual lab and stage. Finally, we present first results and our experiences in developing and using the Allosphere in several prototype projects. </div> </li>

The computational nature of the medium has suggested algorithmic approaches to composition in the form of generative musical structure at the note level and above, and audio signal processing at the level of individual samples. In the region between these levels, the domain of microsound, we may wish to investigate the musical potential of sonic particles that interrelate both signal processing and generative structure. In this thesis I present a software platform (`Vessel') for the exploration of such potential. In particular, a solution to the efficient scheduling of interleaved sound synthesis and algorithmic control with sample accuracy is expounded. The formal foundations, design and implementation are described, the project is contrasted with existing work, and avenues for musical application and future exploration are proposed. </div> </li>
