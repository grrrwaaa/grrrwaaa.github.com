		"summary": "This course addresses computation as a creative medium from a biologically-inspired standpoint to develop artworks, adaptive media and simulations approaching the fascinating complexity of nature. Artists, composers, designers and architects have always drawn inspiration from nature, but until recently only rarely have they been able to leverage natureâ€™s creative mechanisms. From its origins computing has also found biological inspiration in pattern formation, self-construction and reproduction, intelligence, autonomy and collective behaviour. Frameworks explored in the course include complex dynamical systems, fractals, cellular automata, agent-based systems, evolutionary and developmental programming, artificial chemistries and ecosystems. The course is focused on practice in the arts, interactive media, and design: interactive audiovisual applications are implemented both in-class and through student projects, and are critically examined by interweaving the history, theory and landmark works in the literature of generative art, evolutionary music and art, and process art, as well as artificial life, systems biology, and bioinformatics research, and philosophies of process, creativity, and the aesthetics of nature."

Students will learn what a database is, how it is constructed, how it is accessed through the web, and how it may be mapped and envisioned for effective dissemination."

At the same time, the course asks: what does programming for perceptual media imply for creativity, art, design and culture? Historic disciplines of art and music (and theatre, film, sculpture, architecture, engineering, philosophy) converge and diverge into less distinguishable categories, movements, tendencies, moments... some or many of these may become the seeds for great cultural contributions of the future. We aim to nurture these seeds through the application of computation. But like any interaction, passes influences in two directions, so we may also ask how understanding media may influence software and technology development in the future."

Not only does it connect everything from video processing, sound synthesis, device interaction, 3D rendering, networking and scripting languages, it is itself a visual programming language with which is compositionally open to a boundless diversity of mappings and logics of interaction and behavior, and very firmly rooted in a notion of real-time interactive computation. The course is focused on using Cosm running on top of Max/MSP/Jitter, a powerful set of tools for the design of real-time computed operations and 3D graphics processing. This advanced course will focus on building a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of Cosm, the workshop will cover how to build agents, character and behaviors and responsive 3D worlds."
