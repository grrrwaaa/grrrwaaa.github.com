	"annote": "Virtual Reality (VR) is poised to revolutionize creative industries, yet lacks refined VR-native authoring tools. Our research will develop novel interaction concepts and software tools that exploit the medium’s unique affordances for artists of all kinds to create worlds while fully immersed within them. We will augment continuous hand gestures with simulated physics for intuitive freeform modeling with rich, fluid complexity, and develop new paradigms of programming VR live utilizing directly manipulable and spatially meaningful representations for collaborative multi-user productivity. This research is ideally timed to address VR’s vital needs and underpin Ontario’s rapidly growing digital media economy and communities."
